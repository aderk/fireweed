# Fireweed
A toy project of trying out MojoðŸ”¥ with a Bloom filter. Why a Bloom filter?
 * Limited API
 * Super fun w/ probability and bit operations
   * Seemingly does the impossible measuring containment w/o storing more than several bits per item
 * Useful
 * Extendable to Cuckoo, kMinHash, HyperLogLog(++), Counting Bloom Filters, etc.

# Installation And Running
1. Install Mojo
2. Install python (probably via miniconda)
3. Set MOJO_PYTHON_LIBRARY
4. pip install rbloom
5. mojo run main.ðŸ”¥

# Benchmark Results
Benchmarks always have some unfairness, so take these with a grain of salt. This compares python with a rust library to mojo with a mojo library, which is very much apples-to-oranges. Disclaimers aside, for 10M insertions and membership checks. rbloom/python takes about 1.7s and this Mojo implementation takes about 0.6s.

# Future work
 * Investigate TODOs/HACKs/MUSINGs
 * Currently it scales very poorly above ~100k elements on an M2 MBA, not sure what's going on there.
 * Performance profiling
 * Write a real test suite

This project borrows heavily from https://github.com/KenanHanke/rbloom, which is very readable and well designed. Bloom filters were originally proposed in [(Bloom, 1970)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/362686.362692).
